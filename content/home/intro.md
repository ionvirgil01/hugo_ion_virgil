👋 Hello! I’m **Ion Virgil**, and I’m a statistician. Data is a strong enough passion for me that I’ve managed to build something meaningful out of it — especially because, surprisingly, I discover new things every day, from fields I never imagined I’d explore.

I adapt my style and technical knowledge based on my clients’ needs, combining programming with any statistical software, and I approach complex analyses with genuine interest.

Data analysis doesn’t follow a one-size-fits-all template — on the contrary, each analysis needs to be approached with precision and, of course, with results that are easy to explain.

If you need my help or have questions about what I can do for you, feel free to reach out on LinkedIn, Instagram, or Facebook.

Check out my [resumé](/about/) and portfolio below 😍
